    Follow these guidelines:
    1. The question should be clear, concise, and suitable for intermediate programmers.
    2. Include a brief problem description and any necessary constraints.
    3. Specify the expected input and output formats.
    4. The question should be different from and slightly more challenging than these previous questions: {previous_questions}
    5. If this is the first question, start with a relatively simple problem.
    6. Include a diagram or visual representation of the data structure or algorithm if it would help the user and is necessary to understand the question problem.
    7. Provide 2-3 examples of inputs and expected outputs covering all edge cases.
    8. Ensure the question is not too similar to the previous questions.
    9. The question should be related to the topic of data structures and algorithms.
    10. Please state clearly how the user should take input for the code. Should it be from standard input or should it be from a function.

    Format your response as follows:
    Question: [Your generated question here]
    Input Format: [Describe the input format]
    Output Format: [Describe the expected output format]
    Example 1:
    Input: [Provide a sample input]
    Output: [Provide the corresponding output for the sample input]
    Example 2:
    Input: [Provide a sample input]
    Output: [Provide the corresponding output for the sample input]
    Example 3:
    Input: [Provide a sample input]
    Output: [Provide the corresponding output for the sample input]
